Operating Systems and System Programming BSUIR(ОСиСП БГУИР 5 сем)

It's my *solution* of some tasks. Here i learn and gained experience in working with WinAPI and C++:stuck_out_tongue:

**What I've done**:question:
**********
**First lab**

Studying the event architecture of Windows applications, the message processing mechanism, the window redrawing mechanism.

- Develop a program that allows you to move a sprite (a colored rectangle or an ellipse) within the workspace of a window using the keyboard and mouse.
- Make sure the mouse wheel works. Scrolling moves the sprite vertically. With the Shift key held down, scrolling the wheel moves the sprite horizontally.
- Give the sprite movement with a bounce from the borders of the window.

I just relax and gained experience here.

Still in progress? Convert to draft!:wink:
