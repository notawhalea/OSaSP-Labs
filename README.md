Operating Systems and System Programming BSUIR(ОСиСП БГУИР 5 сем)

It's my *solution* of some tasks. Here i learn and gained experience in working with WinAPI and C++:stuck_out_tongue:

**What I've done**:question:
**********
**First lab**:hamster:

Studying the event architecture:factory: of Windows applications, the message processing mechanism, the window redrawing mechanism.

- Develop a program that allows you to move a sprite (a colored rectangle or an ellipse) within the workspace of a window using the keyboard and mouse.
- Make sure the mouse wheel works. Scrolling moves the sprite vertically. With the Shift key held down, scrolling the wheel moves the sprite horizontally.
- Give the sprite movement with a bounce from the borders of the window.
**********
**Second lab**:whale2:

Learning the output of text and fonts.:computer:

- Develop a program that fits into a window a text table (N rows by M columns) in such a way that all columns of the table are evenly
are distributed across the width of the window, and the height of the rows of the table is selected in such a way as to accommodate the text of each cell.
- When resizing the window, the table is recalculated and redrawn.
**********
**Third lab**:dog:

Learn how to create and use dynamically-loaded libraries (DLLs), a method of injecting a DLL into another process using a remote thread.

- Develop a DLL with a function that searches the entire virtual memory for a given string and replaces it with another string.
- Develop a program that performs a static import of a DLL and calls its function.
- Develop a program that performs a dynamic import of a DLL and calls its function.
- Develop a program that injects a DLL into a given process using a remote thread and calls a DLL function.

I just relax and gained experience here.

Still in progress? Convert to draft!:wink:
